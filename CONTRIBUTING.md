# ü§ù Contributing to BabylonPiles

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome all contributions‚Äîcode, documentation, bug reports, and feature requests.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors (Docker-Only)

The only supported way to develop and test BabylonPiles is with Docker. This ensures your environment matches production and other contributors.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker (with Docker Compose support)
- Git for version control
- Python 3.7+ for running tests

### 2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VictoKu1/babylonpiles.git
cd babylonpiles
```

### 3. Start the development environment
```bash
# Option 1: Use the unified script (recommended)
./babylonpiles.sh

# Option 2: Manual Docker commands
docker-compose up --build -d
```

**Note:** The unified script now includes multi-location storage allocation during startup, allowing you to configure specific storage locations for development.

### 4. Access the app
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8080/docs
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

### 5. Making changes
- Edit code in your local repo as usual.
- Docker volumes ensure your changes are reflected in the running containers.
- Use `docker-compose restart` to restart services if needed.

### 6. Running tests
- **Test Suite**: All tests are located in the `tests/` directory
- **Individual Tests**: Run specific tests with `python tests/test_name.py`
- **Test Categories**: API, System, and Functionality tests
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure backend is running on `http://localhost:8080`
- **Documentation**: See [Test Suite README](tests/README.md) for detailed information

### 7. Writing new tests
- Follow the test structure in `tests/README.md`
- Use descriptive test names and clear documentation
- Ensure proper cleanup and error handling
- Add new tests to the test documentation

### 8. Running all tests
```bash
# Run the test suite
python tests/run_all_tests.py

# Run specific test categories
python tests/test_storage_api.py
python tests/test_permissions.py
```

## üìù Code Style & Guidelines

### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP8 for Python code
- Use type hints where possible
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Handle exceptions properly with meaningful error messages

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write meaningful component documentation

### General Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Write comprehensive docstrings and comments
- Follow the existing code structure and patterns
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Update documentation when adding new features

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Test script for [feature name]
"""

import asyncio
import aiohttp
import json

# Test configuration
BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080"

async def test_feature_name():
    """Test description"""
    print("Testing [Feature Name]")
    print("=" * 50)
    
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        # Test implementation
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(test_feature_name())
```

### Test Best Practices
1. **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive test names
2. **Isolation**: Tests should be independent
3. **Cleanup**: Always clean up test data
4. **Documentation**: Include clear descriptions
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error reporting

### Test Categories
- **API Tests**: Test backend endpoints and responses
- **System Tests**: Test system functionality and integration
- **Functionality Tests**: Test specific features and workflows
