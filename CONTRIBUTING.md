# ü§ù Contributing to BabylonPiles

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome all contributions‚Äîcode, documentation, bug reports, and feature requests.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors (Docker-Only)

The only supported way to develop and test BabylonPiles is with Docker. This ensures your environment matches production and other contributors.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker (with Docker Compose support)

### 2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VictoKu1/babylonpiles.git
cd babylonpiles
```

### 3. Storage Management
BabylonPiles uses Docker volumes for optimal performance:
- **Fast Docker builds** (no large files in build context)
- **Persistent data** (survives container restarts)
- **Easy access** via provided access script

**Access your data:**
```bash
# Linux/macOS
chmod +x access_storage.sh
./access_storage.sh

# Windows (using Git Bash, WSL, or PowerShell)
# Option 1: Use Git Bash (recommended)
./access_storage.sh

# Option 2: Use PowerShell
docker run --rm -v babylonpiles_piles:/data -v ${PWD}/your_zim_files:/source alpine sh -c "cp /source/*.zim /data/"
```

### 4. Start the development environment
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 5. Access the app
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8080/docs
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Kiwix-Serve: http://localhost:8081

### 6. Making changes
- Edit code in your local repo as usual.
- Docker volumes ensure your changes are reflected in the running containers.
- Use `docker-compose restart` to restart services if needed.

### 7. Running tests
- (Add test instructions here if available)

### 8. Troubleshooting
If you experience slow startup times:
```bash
# Clean up Docker system (removes unused images, containers, volumes, and build cache)
docker system prune -a --volumes
```
