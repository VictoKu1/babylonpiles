## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, please use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/about-private-vulnerability-reporting) feature for this repository.
This ensures your report is only visible to the maintainers.

We will respond as soon as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure.

## Security Best Practices

- Always keep your dependencies up to date.
- Do not share sensitive information (such as credentials or API keys) in public forums or code.
- Review third-party modules for security before use.

## Disclosure Policy

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 2 business days and strive to resolve all security issues promptly.
