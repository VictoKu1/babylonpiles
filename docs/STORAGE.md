```

### File Permissions

#### Public/Private Access Control

BabylonPiles includes a permission system that allows users to control access to files and folders. Each file and folder can be marked as either public or private.

#### Permission Features

**Default Behavior:**
- All new files and folders are private by default
- Private files are only accessible to the owner
- Public files can be accessed by other users

**Permission Management:**
- Toggle permissions directly from the file browser
- Visual indicators show current permission status
- Permissions are stored in a `.permissions.json` file
- Changes take effect immediately

#### User Interface

**File Browser:**
- Permission toggle switches on each file/folder row
- Visual icons: üåê for public, üîí for private
- Hover tooltips show current status and action
- Click to toggle between public and private

**Permission Indicators:**
- **Public (üåê)**: File/folder is accessible to other users
- **Private (üîí)**: File/folder is only accessible to owner
- Hover effects provide visual feedback
- Smooth transitions when toggling

#### API Endpoints

**Get Permission Status:**
```bash
GET /api/v1/files/permission/{file_path}
```

**Set Permission:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/files/permission/{file_path}
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

is_public=true
```

**Toggle Permission:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/files/permission/{file_path}/toggle
```

#### Usage Examples

**Making a file public:**
1. Navigate to the file in the browser
2. Click the üîí icon next to the file
3. Icon changes to üåê indicating public access
4. File is now accessible to other users

**Making a folder private:**
1. Navigate to the folder in the browser
2. Click the üåê icon next to the folder
3. Icon changes to üîí indicating private access
4. Folder and contents are now private

**Bulk permission management:**
- Permissions are inherited by default
- Child files/folders can have different permissions
- Parent folder permissions don't override child permissions

#### Security Considerations

**Permission Storage:**
- Permissions stored in `.permissions.json` file
- File is hidden from normal browsing
- JSON format for easy backup and restore
- Automatic cleanup when files are deleted

**Access Control:**
- Private files are completely hidden from other users
- Public files appear in shared listings
- No intermediate permission levels (only public/private)
- Permissions apply to both files and folders

**Best Practices:**
- Use private for personal or sensitive content
- Use public for shared resources and collaboration
- Regularly review and update permissions
- Consider folder-level permissions for organization
